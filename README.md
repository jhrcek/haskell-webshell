# hwesh

This is a webshell in Haskell.

More documentation will come some day. For now there is a recording of a webinar that describes the
implementation on [fpcomplete.com](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/rio-standard-library-for-haskell)
and a copy on [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu0ZCqQe3BY) along with the [corresponding
slides](slides-rio-webinar-rio.md) in this repo.
